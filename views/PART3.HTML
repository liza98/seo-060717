      <p> <b> <h2> In your own words, what is the difference between ON-PAGE SEO and OFF-PAGE SEO? </p> </b> </h2>  
        <p> ON-PAGE SEO is the act of optimizing different parts of your web site that affect your search engine rankings. It's stuff that you have control over and can change on your own website. While, the OFF-PAGE SEO focuses on increasing the authority of your domain through the act of getting links from other websites.</p>
