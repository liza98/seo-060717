      <p>SEO is essentially a component of the larger category, According to Google's Knowledge Graph, search engine optimization is "the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine."</p> </div>

 <p> Search engines do use the keywords in domain names as a ranking factor (which explains the existence of domains like "where-to-buy-the-best-donuts-in-Seattle.com"), but tread lightly when thinking about optimizing your root domain for search engines: One of the specific functions of Google's algorithm is to combat these keyword-stuffed exact-match domains.

 <p>This link building strategy is, of course, the easiest one to do. Why? Well because it's a factor that you can manipulate 100% since the link is located within your website. It is arguably an on-site element but it is an off-site factor since you are doing internal linking for the search engine crawlers and PR sculpting.

 <p>The title (i.e., headline) of your blog post will be a search engine's and reader's first step in determining the relevancy of your content, so including a keyword here is vital. 

 Be sure to include your keyword within the first 65 characters of your headline, which is just about where Google cuts it off on search engine results pages (SERPs). Technically, Google measures by pixel width, not character count, and it recently increased the pixel width for organic search results from approximately 500 pixels to approximately 600 pixels, which translates into around 65 characters.

This all starts with your meta descriptions which is essentially the welcome mat to your site's virtual doorway. Be sure to incorporate these tips to ensure you're presenting the best first impression you can. s

 <p>In the murky waters of search engine optimization (SEO) rests a lot of technical terminology like meta data, title tags and backlinks. If you’re trying to get SEO in order, it can be especially overwhelming to know where to start. 

 Fortunately, SEO is often taken piece by piece and each element contributes to an overall strategy for success. 

Search gurus have talked a lot about how search engines crawl and index websites and the importance of optimizing your content to increase your organic search rank. One important piece that’s often overlooked is ensuring images on your site are appropriately labeled or"tagged" Paying attention to the alternative text (often referred to as alt tags or alt attributes) can increase your chances of search engine success.

 <p>Merge factors, which decide how the information enters the index, deciding whether the data is new data or data that is being updated. Index size, which pertains to the amount of computer space necessary to support the index. 

 Storage techniques, which is the decision of how the information should be stored. Larger files are compressed while smaller files are simply filtered. Fault tolerance refers to the issue of how important it is for the search engine index to be reliable. 

Lookup speed is exactly as it sounds, pertaining to how quickly a word can be found when the data is searched in the inverted index. Maintenance is an important factor as well because the better maintained a search engine index, the better it works.
